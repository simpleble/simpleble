description: Run and use the SimplePyBLE MCP server.
---

The SimplePyBLE MCP server provides local BLE tools to MCP-capable clients. It is designed for development, debugging, and AI-assisted workflows that need direct access to BLE hardware on the host machine.

## Installation

First, install the package with the `mcp` extra:

```bash
pip install "simplepyble[mcp]"
```

<details open>
<summary><b>Install in Cursor</b></summary>

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simpleble": {
      "command": "simpleble-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

*Note: You must have installed the package first via `pip install "simplepyble[mcp]"`. If `simpleble-mcp` is not in your system PATH, you may need to provide the full path to the executable.*

<summary><b>Install in Claude Code</b></summary>

Run this command. See [Claude Code MCP docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) for more info.

#### Claude Code Local Server Connection

```sh
claude mcp add simpleble -- simpleble-mcp
```

<details>
<summary><b>Install in Opencode</b></summary>

Add this to your Opencode configuration file. See [Opencode MCP docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers) for more info.

#### Opencode Local Server Connection

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "simpleble": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["simpleble-mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool catalog

All tool inputs/outputs are JSON-serializable. Byte values are returned as hex strings with a best-effort UTF-8 decode.

### `get_adapters`
List available Bluetooth adapters.

Response:
```json
[
  {"identifier": "Default Adapter [UUID]", "address": "UUID"}
]
```

### `scan_for(timeout_ms=5000, adapter_index=0)`
Scan for nearby BLE devices.

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "identifier": "DeviceName",
    "address": "UUID-or-MAC",
    "rssi": -55,
    "connectable": true,
    "manufacturer_data": {"76": "0215..."}
  }
]
```

### `connect(address)`
Connect to a device found in the last scan.

Response:
```json
{"message": "Connected to DeviceName", "address": "UUID-or-MAC"}
```

### `disconnect(address)`
Disconnect from a connected device.

Response:
```json
{"message": "Disconnected from DeviceName", "address": "UUID-or-MAC"}
```

### `services(address)`
List services and characteristics for a connected device.

Response:
```json
{
  "identifier": "DeviceName",
  "address": "UUID-or-MAC",
  "connected": true,
  "mtu": 23,
  "services": [
    {"uuid": "service-uuid", "characteristics": ["char-uuid"]}
  ]
}
```

### `read(address, service_uuid, char_uuid)`
Read a characteristic value.

Response:
```json
{
  "service_uuid": "service-uuid",
  "char_uuid": "char-uuid",
  "data_hex": "00aabb",
  "data_utf8": "..."
}
```

### `notify(address, service_uuid, char_uuid, duration_ms=5000)`
Subscribe to notifications for a duration and return collected samples, then unsubscribe.

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "service": "service-uuid",
    "characteristic": "char-uuid",
    "data_hex": "163c00",
    "data_utf8": "...",
    "type": "notification"
  }
]
```

## Recommended flow

1. `get_adapters`
2. `scan_for`
3. `connect`
4. `services`
5. `read` or `notify`
6. `disconnect`

## Platform notes

- On macOS/iOS, device “address” is a UUID, not a MAC address.
- Advertisement fields (RSSI, manufacturer data, service UUIDs) can vary by OS and device.
- Some characteristics require pairing or may be restricted by the OS.

## MCP client example (FastMCP via HTTP)

If you are running the server manually using the HTTP transport (`simpleble-mcp --transport http`), you can connect to it using a FastMCP client:

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    # Connect to the server running on the default port 8000
    async with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp") as client:
        adapters = await client.call_tool("get_adapters", {})
        # ...
```

Note: FastMCP returns structured results under `structured_content` rather than `data` for some tool outputs.

## Running the server manually

While Cursor handles starting the server automatically, you can also run it manually for testing.

**STDIO Transport (Default):**
```bash
simpleble-mcp
```

**HTTP Transport:**
```bash
simpleble-mcp --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
