SimpleBLE works on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Please follow the instructions below to build and run SimplePyBLE in your specific environment.

## Installing from PyPI

The fastest way to get going with SimplePyBLE is to install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simplepyble
```

Please take into consideration that when using this library on Linux, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
```

## Installing locally

If you wish to install SimplePyBLE locally, either for development purposes or to access the latest features, you can do so by cloning the repository and installing it with pip:

```bash
cd <path-to-simpleble>/simplepyble
pip install .
```

## MCP Server

SimplePyBLE also ships an MCP server powered by FastMCP for local tool access from MCP-capable clients. To use the MCP server, you need to install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install simplepyble[mcp]
```

Run the MCP server over STDIO (default) or HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m simplepyble.mcp_server
python3 -m simplepyble.mcp_server --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Manual smoke test: use an MCP client to call `get_adapters` and `scan_for` once the server is running**.**
